# Mindful Bell App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Mindfulness-First Design
Every feature must support mindful awareness and presence. User interface elements should promote calm focus rather than distraction. No addictive patterns, infinite scroll, or anxiety-inducing notifications. The app serves the user's mindfulness practice, not engagement metrics.

### II. Offline-First Architecture
The app must function completely offline with local data storage. All core features (bell scheduling, note capture, data viewing) work without internet connection. Cloud sync is optional enhancement, never a dependency. Users maintain full control of their personal practice data.

### III. Privacy by Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
No user data leaves the device without explicit consent. Personal observations, practice notes, and usage patterns remain strictly private. No analytics, tracking pixels, or behavioral data collection. Open source implementation ensures transparency and user trust.

### IV. Simplicity and Focus
Each screen serves one primary purpose with minimal cognitive load. Navigation paths are intuitive and require ≤3 taps to reach any feature. Visual design emphasizes calm, supportive aesthetics with generous whitespace and gentle transitions. Complexity must be justified against mindfulness principles.

### V. Reliable Bell System
Bell notifications are the core feature and must be dependable. Battery optimization conflicts are resolved in favor of notification reliability. Users can configure quiet hours, density, and notification windows. The system gracefully handles device sleep states and background restrictions.

## Development Standards

Core development follows React Native/Expo best practices with TypeScript. Component architecture emphasizes reusability and clear separation of concerns. State management uses context or simple state solutions rather than complex libraries. Accessibility features are built-in, not added later.

## Quality Assurance

All features require user testing with actual meditation practitioners. Performance testing ensures smooth operation on older devices. Bell timing accuracy is tested across device states (locked, background, low battery). Visual design follows calming UI principles with liquid-glass aesthetics inspired by Apple's design language.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Feature requests are evaluated against mindfulness principles before technical feasibility. Breaking changes require documentation of impact on user practice routines. Privacy commitments are non-negotiable and require community review for any modifications.
