# Implementation Plan â€“ Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas itself is a strategic artifact, not directly implemented in code.
However, we can integrate it into our workflow by:

1. Keeping the canvas in the repo for version control.
2. Using it as input for product roadmap and prioritization.
3. Reviewing metrics quarterly and updating the canvas accordingly.

## Risks
- Risk: metrics not measurable without analytics.
- Mitigation: start with local logging (CSV export) before adding analytics.

## Usage
- Reference during sprint planning to ensure features align with UVP.
- Update Key Metrics as app matures.
