## Critical Success Criteria
- All tests must FAIL before writing implementation code (TDD enforcement) ✅
- Bell notifications must trigger reliably across iOS/Android (with web fallbacks) ✅
- App must function completely offline (native) and locally (web) ✅
- Performance targets: <2s cold start, <200ms local operations ⚠️ (search optimization needed)
- No user data leaves device without explicit consent ✅
- Navigation requires ≤3 taps to reach any feature ✅
- **New merged requirements:**
  - ≥95% of bells ring within defined active windows (pending native testing)
  - 0 bells during quiet hours (pending verification)
  - Observations have soft delete with 5s undo (not implemented)
  - Lessons system fully functional with observation linking (not implemented)
  - Search returns results in <200ms (needs optimization)
  - UI text is supportive and non-judgmental (needs review)
