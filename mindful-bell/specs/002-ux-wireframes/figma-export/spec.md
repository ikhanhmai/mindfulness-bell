# UX Wireframes – Mindful Bell App

## Overview
The UX wireframes define the user interface flows for the app.
Focus is on simplicity, calming UI, and offline-first interaction.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want an onboarding flow to configure my bell schedule quickly.
- As a user, I want a Home screen to see the next bell and capture observations.
- As a user, I want to be prompted with a quick note sheet when a bell rings.
- As a user, I want to browse my Observations and Lessons in lists.
- As a user, I want to see simple statistics of my practice.
- As a user, I want to configure settings like quiet hours, windows, density, and sounds.

## Functional Requirements
- Onboarding screens (3 steps).
- Home screen with "Next Bell" and "Quick Capture".
- Notification → Acknowledge → Quick note.
- List screens for Observations and Lessons.
- Stats screen with daily/weekly numbers.
- Settings screen with active windows, quiet hours, density, sounds.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Every screen has empty/loading/populated states.
- [ ] Onboarding completes in ≤3 steps.
- [ ] Quick capture available from Home and from Bell.
- [ ] All flows reachable within 2–3 taps.

## Design Vibe Guidelines
- Calming, supportive, and non-judgmental.
- Neutral backgrounds with pastel green/blue accents.
- Rounded corners, generous white space, large tap targets.
- Typography: clean sans-serif, legible, not too dense.
- Empty/error states use gentle copy: “Take a breath, nothing here yet.”
- **Liquid-glass vibe inspired by Apple:**
  - Translucent backgrounds with subtle blur.
  - Layered cards with depth and frosted-glass effect.
  - Soft shadows and highlights to create floating elements.
  - Gentle motion/animations (fade, slide) instead of harsh transitions.
