# Implementation Plan – UX Wireframes

## Tools
- Figma for design.
- Export PNG/PDF into specs/002-ux-wireframes/figma-export/.

## Screens
1. **Onboarding (3 screens)**: permissions, schedule preferences, confirmation.
2. **Home**: next bell, quick capture button.
3. **Capture Sheet**: modal to add observation.
4. **Notification Ack**: acknowledge bell, optional note.
5. **Observations List**: filter by type.
6. **Lessons List**: link to details.
7. **Stats**: simple counters, chart.
8. **Settings**: quiet hours, density, sounds.

## Design Principles
- 8px grid for spacing.
- Typography scale (title, body, caption).
- Calm, neutral colors.
- Friendly empty/error states.

## Risks
- Too many screens → complexity.
- Mitigation: keep flows minimal, reuse components.

## Usage
- Dev team uses Figma exports and this spec as reference.
- QA ensures empty/error states exist per checklist.
