# Implementation Plan: App Store Publishing with EAS

**Branch**: `002-create-the-specification` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-create-the-specification/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ SUCCESS: Feature spec loaded
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature enables automated iOS app publishing through Expo Application Services (EAS), providing streamlined build automation, code signing with Apple Developer certificates, and direct submission to App Store Connect for the mindfulness bell app.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React Native/Expo SDK
**Primary Dependencies**: Expo CLI, EAS CLI, App Store Connect API
**Storage**: Local build artifacts, EAS build storage (30 days dev, unlimited prod)
**Testing**: Jest for build configuration validation, end-to-end submission testing
**Target Platform**: iOS 15+ via App Store Connect
**Project Type**: mobile - React Native/Expo application with EAS build pipeline
**Performance Goals**: Build completion within 10 minutes, submission within 5 minutes
**Constraints**: Apple Developer Account required, App Store Connect API Key authentication, wellness app guidelines compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Single iOS app deployment pipeline with automated metadata management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Mindfulness-First Design ✅
- **PASS**: Publishing pipeline serves user mindfulness practice by enabling reliable app distribution
- **PASS**: No engagement metrics or addictive patterns in deployment workflow

### Offline-First Architecture ✅
- **PASS**: Publishing workflow is external to core app; app remains fully offline-capable
- **PASS**: No impact on user data locality or privacy

### Privacy by Design ✅
- **PASS**: Build process uses App Store Connect API Key (secure authentication)
- **PASS**: No user analytics or tracking in deployment pipeline
- **PASS**: Compliance with wellness app privacy guidelines

### Simplicity and Focus ✅
- **PASS**: Single-purpose workflow: build → sign → submit
- **PASS**: Manual rejection handling maintains developer control
- **PASS**: Standard metadata fields avoid complexity

### Reliable Bell System ✅
- **PASS**: Publishing pipeline does not affect core app reliability
- **PASS**: No impact on notification system

app.json                 # Expo app configuration
.easignore              # Files to exclude from builds
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 (Mobile + API) - React Native/Expo mobile app with EAS build pipeline

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - EAS build configuration best practices
   - App Store Connect API authentication setup
   - iOS build optimization for Expo apps
   - Apple wellness app guidelines compliance

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research EAS build configuration for React Native apps"
   Task: "Find best practices for App Store Connect API Key authentication"
   Task: "Research iOS build optimization patterns for Expo applications"
   Task: "Research Apple wellness app guidelines and privacy requirements"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Build Configuration (profiles, environment variables)
   - App Metadata (name, description, keywords, screenshots)
   - Apple Developer Assets (certificates, API keys)
   - Build Artifacts (IPA files, logs, receipts)
   - Release Workflow (status tracking, submission automation)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - EAS Build API integration contracts
   - App Store Connect API submission contracts
   - Build status monitoring interfaces
   - Output schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - EAS build configuration validation tests
   - App Store Connect submission flow tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Complete build and submission workflow
   - Build failure and retry scenarios
   - App Store rejection handling

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude Code
   - Add EAS/Expo deployment context
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → configuration creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Configuration before build before submission
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent configuration files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all checks pass*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
