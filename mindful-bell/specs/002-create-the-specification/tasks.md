# Tasks: App Store Publishing with EAS

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-create-the-specification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ SUCCESS: Mobile + API structure with EAS build pipeline
   → Extract: TypeScript, React Native/Expo SDK, EAS CLI, App Store Connect API
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → Build Configuration, App Metadata, Apple Developer Assets, Build Artifacts, Release Workflow
   → contracts/: EAS Build API, App Store Connect API → contract test tasks
   → research.md: EAS configuration, API authentication, optimization, compliance
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: EAS configuration, dependencies, project structure
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, validation scenarios
   → Core: configuration models, workflow services, API integrations
   → Integration: authentication, error handling, status monitoring
   → Polish: optimization, documentation, end-to-end validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Configuration files = parallel execution possible
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: ✅ All contracts, entities, and user stories covered
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Store API keys securely, never in version control
- Follow wellness app guidelines for App Store compliance
- Test on actual devices before production submission

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - EAS Build API contract → T005, T006 (contract tests)
   - App Store Connect API contract → T007, T008 (contract tests)
   - Each endpoint → corresponding service implementation

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Build Configuration entity → T013 (model creation)
   - App Metadata entity → T014 (model creation)
   - Apple Developer Assets entity → T015 (model creation)
   - Build Artifacts entity → T016 (model creation)
   - Release Workflow entity → T017 (model creation)

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Development build story → T009 (integration test)
   - Production submission story → T010 (integration test)
   - Error handling scenarios → T011 (integration test)
   - Optimization requirements → T012 (integration test)

4. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Development build validation → T046 (end-to-end test)
   - Production build optimization → T046 (end-to-end test)
   - App Store submission → T046 (end-to-end test)
   - Metadata validation → T046 (end-to-end test)
   - Error handling → T046 (end-to-end test)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
