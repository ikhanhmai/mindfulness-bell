# Feature Specification: App Store Publishing with EAS

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-the-specification`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create the specification for help me easily publish the app to appstore by expo Expo Application Services https://expo.dev/eas"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extract: "publish app to App Store using EAS"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: App developer/publisher
   � Actions: Build, sign, submit to App Store
   � Data: App metadata, certificates, provisioning profiles
   � Constraints: Apple App Store requirements, EAS service limitations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Apple Developer Account details]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: App Store metadata requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: Developer initiates build � EAS processes � App Store submission
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Build automation, code signing, metadata management, submission workflow
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Build configuration, App metadata, Certificates, Provisioning profiles
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Mark clarifications needed for Apple Developer setup
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What Apple Developer authentication method will you use with EAS? → A: App Store Connect API Key (recommended for automation)
- Q: How should the system handle App Store rejections? → A: Manual review and resubmission only
- Q: How long should EAS builds be retained? → A: anytime you recommend
- Q: Which App Store metadata fields are required for your app? → A: Standard (basic + keywords, screenshots, privacy policy)
- Q: Which Apple App Store guidelines are most relevant for your mindfulness bell app? → A: Wellness app guidelines with privacy focus

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an app developer, I want to easily publish my React Native/Expo app to the Apple App Store using Expo Application Services (EAS) so that I can distribute my mindfulness bell app to iOS users without complex manual build and submission processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a completed Expo app, **When** I configure EAS build settings, **Then** EAS should automatically build a signed iOS app binary
2. **Given** I have valid Apple Developer credentials, **When** I run EAS submit, **Then** the app should be automatically uploaded to App Store Connect
3. **Given** I need to update my app, **When** I increment the version and run EAS build/submit, **Then** the new version should be processed for App Store review
4. **Given** I want to test before production, **When** I create a preview build, **Then** I should be able to install and test the app via TestFlight or direct installation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Apple Developer certificates expire during the build process?
- How does the system handle App Store rejection and resubmission workflow?
- What occurs if the app bundle size exceeds Apple's limits?
- How are build failures communicated and resolved?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically build iOS app binaries from Expo/React Native source code
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle code signing with Apple Developer certificates and provisioning profiles
- **FR-003**: System MUST support automatic submission to App Store Connect
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide build status monitoring and error reporting
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple build profiles (development, preview, production)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate app metadata requirements before submission
- **FR-007**: System MUST support version management and automatic increment
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle standard App Store metadata fields (name, description, category, keywords, screenshots, privacy policy)
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate with Apple services using App Store Connect API Key for automated submission
- **FR-010**: System MUST support build retention using EAS default policy (30 days for development builds, unlimited for production)
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle app review process workflow with manual review and resubmission for rejections
- **FR-012**: System MUST comply with Apple wellness app guidelines with enhanced privacy requirements

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Build Configuration**: EAS build settings, platform targets, build profiles, environment variables
- **App Metadata**: App name, bundle identifier, version, description, keywords, category, privacy policy
- **Apple Developer Assets**: Certificates, provisioning profiles, App Store Connect API keys, team information
- **Build Artifacts**: Signed IPA files, source maps, build logs, submission receipts
- **Release Workflow**: Version control integration, build triggers, submission automation, review status tracking
